# ABOUTME

Hi my name is Bryce, the name Brikeuh came from 13 year old me and my cousin saying our names in an overexaggerated way!

- I'm currently working on learning how to use GitHub :)
- My favorite hobby as of now is playing the guitar
- I'm interested in learning about software development and creating programs and applications
