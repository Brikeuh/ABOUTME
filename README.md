# ABOUTME

Hi my name is Bryce! Fun fact, the name Brikeuh came from 13 year old me and my cousin saying our names in an overexaggerated way, and it has become my username for almost everything now. It was fist sounded out as "bre-ke-uh" but many friends ended up saying "brykuh" instead.

- 🎸 My favorite hobby as of now is playing the guitar
